# Blog Website Flask App
=========================

A RESTful Flask application for a blog website, allowing users to view, edit, delete, and create new posts with image support.
The pages are not fully configured and populated yet, but the main functionalities are already in place.

## Features

* View posts from a database
* Edit existing posts
* Delete posts
* Create new posts with image upload (URL or local file)
* RESTful API architecture
* Possible to create users with hashed and salted passwords
* Users have 3 roles: user, admin, and maintainer
  	+ Users can comment on posts
  	+ Admins can also create, edit, and delete posts, as well as delete user comments
  	+ Maintainer can to the same as Admins, plus grant or revoke Admin status, and delete Users
  	+ To create maintainer users run `flask create-maintainer` command in the terminal (or `flask --app main.py create-maintainer` for the full command)
